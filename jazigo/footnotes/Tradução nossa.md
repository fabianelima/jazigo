No original: “_To help define the boundaries of science, lexicographers also contrast science with art. Art refers to the useful practices of a field, not to drawings or sculptures. [...] Programming, design, software and hardware engineering, building and validating models, and building user interfaces are all “computing arts.” If aesthetics is added, the computing arts extend to graphics, layout, drawings, photography, animation, music, games, and entertainment. All this computing art complements and enriches the science_” ([[DENNING, 2005]]).
